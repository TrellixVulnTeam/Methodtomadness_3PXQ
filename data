python is usually used on the server.
Local time zone on a server is usually pointless and should always be set to UTC.
Setting datetime tzinfo this way fails in some cases.
better use UTC, then localize to the wanted timezone only on output.
any timedelta computation for example doesn't consider daylight saving, so these should be done in UTC, then localized.

try using a datetime object localized in a timezone that observes daylight saving, add a number of days to change daylight saving state, and you'll see that operating on datetime objects in localized timezone fails and won't respect daylight saving.
Hence my comment that you should ALWAYS do any datetime operation in UTC time.

the point being: don't do this, do your operations in UTC, and then use datetime.astimezone(timezone) to convert to the localtime zone on output.
