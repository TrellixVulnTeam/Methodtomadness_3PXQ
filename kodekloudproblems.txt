Problem statement:

xFusionCorp Industries utilizes monitoring tools to check the status of every service, application, etc. running on the systems.
The monitoring system identified that Apache service is not running on some of the Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter.
Identify the faulty Nautilus Application Servers and fix the issue.
Also, make sure Apache service is up and running on all Nautilus Application Servers.
Do not try to stop any kind of firewall that is already running.
Apache is running on 5002 port on all Nautilus Application Servers and its document root must be /var/www/html on all app servers.
Finally you can test from jump host using curl command to access Apache on all app servers and it should work fine. E.g. curl http://172.16.238.10:5002/



Solution:

Steps:
1. Checked network level (whether port open, listening,any issue with ip tables), but this didnt help
2. Tried to restart httpd service but it didnt restart
3. Checked whether index.html is there in document root i.e. /var/www/html, it there and no issue with it.
4. After a bit googling came across the command httpd -S,httpd -t, this threw a syntax error in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file.
[root@stapp03 banner]# httpd -S
AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries !
5. Modified the file as per the syntax errors and restarted the httpd service with systemctl start httpd resolved the issue.


problem 2:

As per details shared by the development team, the new application release has some dependencies on the back end. 
There are some packages/services that need to be installed on all app servers under Stratos Datacenter. 
As per requirements please perform the following steps:
a. Install httpd package on all the application servers.
b. Once installed, make sure it is enabled to start during boot.

Solution:

steps:
1.checked the package is installed or not with below commands
yum list installed|grep httpd
or
rpm -qa|grep httpd
2.Install the package and enable it.
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd
