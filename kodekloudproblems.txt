Problem statement:

xFusionCorp Industries utilizes monitoring tools to check the status of every service, application, etc. running on the systems.
The monitoring system identified that Apache service is not running on some of the Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter.
Identify the faulty Nautilus Application Servers and fix the issue.
Also, make sure Apache service is up and running on all Nautilus Application Servers.
Do not try to stop any kind of firewall that is already running.
Apache is running on 5002 port on all Nautilus Application Servers and its document root must be /var/www/html on all app servers.
Finally you can test from jump host using curl command to access Apache on all app servers and it should work fine. E.g. curl http://172.16.238.10:5002/



Solution:

Steps:
1. Checked network level (whether port open, listening,any issue with ip tables), but this didnt help
2. Tried to restart httpd service but it didnt restart
3. Checked whether index.html is there in document root i.e. /var/www/html, it there and no issue with it.
4. After a bit googling came across the command httpd -S,httpd -t, this threw a syntax error in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file.
[root@stapp03 banner]# httpd -S
AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries !
5. Modified the file as per the syntax errors and restarted the httpd service with systemctl start httpd resolved the issue.


problem 2:

As per details shared by the development team, the new application release has some dependencies on the back end. 
There are some packages/services that need to be installed on all app servers under Stratos Datacenter. 
As per requirements please perform the following steps:
a. Install httpd package on all the application servers.
b. Once installed, make sure it is enabled to start during boot.

Solution:

steps:
1.checked the package is installed or not with below commands
yum list installed|grep httpd
or
rpm -qa|grep httpd
2.Install the package and enable it.
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd

problem 3:

The xFusionCorp Industries security team recently did a security audit of their infrastructure and came up with ideas to improve the application and server security. 
They decided to use SElinux for an additional security layer. 
They are still planning how they will implement it;
however, they have decided to start testing with app servers, so based on the recommendations they have the following requirements:


Install the required packages of SElinux on App server 2 in Stratos Datacenter and disable it permanently for now; 
it will be enabled after making some required configuration changes on this host.
Don't worry about rebooting the server as there is already a reboot scheduled for tonight's maintenance window. 
Also ignore the status of SElinux command line right now; 
the final status after reboot should be disabled.


Trivia:

SELinux implements what’s known as MAC (Mandatory Access Control). 
This is implemented on top of what’s already present in every Linux distribution, the DAC (Discretionary Access Control).
At any one time, SELinux can be in any of three possible modes:
Enforcing
Permissive
Disabled

Detailed concept: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-selinux-on-centos-7-part-1-basic-concepts
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-selinux-on-centos-7-part-2-files-and-processes

Solution:
install selinux packages with the below command and set the SELinux mode to disabled in /etc/selinux/config file. 

yum install -y  policycoreutils policycoreutils-python selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted libselinux-utils setroubleshoot-server setools setools-console mcstrans



Problem 4:

Install cronie and start crond and create a cronjob */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.


Trivia:
syntax of crontab
[Minute] [hour] 
[Day_of_the_Month] 
[Month_of_the_Year] 
[Day_of_the_Week] 
[command]

Solution:
yum install -y cronie
systemctl status crond
systemctl start crond
systemctl status crond
crontab -e and add */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text

Problem 5:
New tools have been installed on the app server in Stratos Datacenter. 
Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. 
Therefore, there are requirements for these app servers.
On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default.

Solution:

systemctl get-default
graphical.target
systemctl set-default 
who -r or $ runlevel

Problem:

Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. 
Make use of the approved template located at /home/thor/nautilus_banner on jump host

Solution:

Edit the /etc/motd file 

The Nautilus system admins team recently deployed a web UI application for their backup utility running on the Nautilus backup server in Stratos Datacenter.
The application is running on port 5001. 
They have firewalld installed on that server. 
The requirements that have come up include the following:
Open all incoming connection on 5001/tcp port. Zone should be public.

Solution:

      firewall-cmd
    2  firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
    3  firewall-cmd --get-services
    4  clear
    5  firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
    6  firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5001/tcp
    7  firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
    8  firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
    9  firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
   10  firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --remove-port=5001/tcp
   11  firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
   12  firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5001/tcp
   13  firewall-cmd --list-all
   14  firewall-cmd --reload
   15  firewall-cmd --reload
   16  firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports

   [root@stapp01 nginx]# grep -i listen /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
[root@stapp01 nginx]#grep -i listen /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

ss -tnlp
[root@stapp01 nginx]# grep -i listen /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
[root@stapp01 nginx]#grep -i listen /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Replace all occurances of the string Text to Maritime on the XML file /root/nautilus.xml located in the backup server.

sed -i 's/Text/Maritime/g' /root/nautilus.xml



The Nautilus production support team was trying to fix issues with their storage server. 
The storage server has a shared directory /nfsshare, which is mounted on all app servers at location /var/www/html so that whatever data they store on storage server under /nfsshare can be shared among all app servers. 
Somehow NFS server is broken and having some issues.


Identify the root cause of the issue and fix it to make sure sharing works fine among all app servers and storage server.

create a user named mariyam on the App Server 3.
Set expiry date to 2021-02-17 in Stratos Datacenter.
Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

Solution:
sudo useradd -e yyyy-mm-dd username

Create a user named kirsty in App Server 3 without a home directory.

Solution:

sudo adduser -M kirsty


There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. 
The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. 
After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.
Look into the issue and fix the same.

Solution:
Identified the configuration file which is in /etc/my.cnf and from that identified the ErrorLog.
From that identified the Permissiondeined error and then checked the permission and changed the ownership.
